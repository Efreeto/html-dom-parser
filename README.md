HTML DOM PARSER https://html-dom-parser.herokuapp.com/ 

This program loads another web page to parse its internal structure, then turn it into a single html file.

Its purpose is to help other non-browser, web crawler programs with no ability to parse into the internal structure on their own. (For example, wget with no option or an in-house company tool that can only read in the first page and not its dependencies)
